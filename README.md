This Project is regarding creation of smart contract showing working of assert,require and revert statements. 
This Solidity contract checks if an individual is eligible to be a Member of Parliament in India. It ensures the person is an Indian citizen and at least 25 years old. The checkEligibility function returns "Eligible to be a Member of Parliament" if all conditions are met. If the criteria are not met, the contract reverts with appropriate error messages.
